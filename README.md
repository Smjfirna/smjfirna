## Projects üöÄ

* [FOODECTION](https://github.com/hildazaqya/project-capstone) A group capstone project in machine learning that focuses on food detection using Deep learning Cnvolutional Neural Network(CNN) algorithms.
* [Mental Healt Chatbot](https://github.com/Smjfirna/Mental-Health-Chatbot) A NLP Model developed during my independent study in Data Science to provide mental health resources.
* [CNN architecture comparison on corn leaf disease classification](https://github.com/Smjfirna/Arsitektur-Compration) My thesis project comparing different CNN architectures for classifying maize leaf diseases.
* [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Smjfirna/Movie_recommendation-system) Project to create a recommendation system from Movielens 100K dataset
* [Data analisys with Streamlit Dashboard](https://github.com/Smjfirna/Bike-Sharing-Data-Analisys) Project Analyze Bike Sharing Dataset data and create interactive dashboard with streamlit
* [Customer churn prediction](https://github.com/Smjfirna/Customer-churn-prediction) predicting customer churn, which refers to the likelihood of a customer discontinuing their use of a company's product or service. By identifying customers who are at risk of churning, businesses can take proactive measures to retain them, thus enhancing customer satisfaction and profitability.
